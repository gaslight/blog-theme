  Title: World Congress of Engineering Asset Management
  Body: ! '<p>We have been working with <a href="http://assetricity.com/">Assetricity</a> implementing
    the <a href="http://www.mimosa.org/">MIMOSA</a> Common Conceptual Object Model
    information standard for operations and maintenance. This year the <a href="http://www.wceam.com/">WCEAM</a>
    was held here in Cincinnati. I was able to attend the Interoperability for Asset
    Management workshop for the last couple of days. While there we ratified the new
    3.2.3 CCOM Markup Language standard I&#8217;ve been working on the last year or
    so.</p>

    <p>This project obviously has a lot of &#8220;big E&#8221; Enterprise baggage.
    The weight of that opening paragraph alone rekindles my rebellion from our corporate
    overlords. I&#8217;ve stuck with this project for several reasons though.</p>

    <p>First, it&#8217;s really hard. Asset management, maintenance, and condition
    monitoring are much more complicated than what I originally thought. It&#8217;s
    an incredibly broad field with many diverse needs across almost all industries.
    There have been many times when I thought, &#8220;there must be an easier way
    to do this.&#8221; However, after understanding more of the context I&#8217;ve
    often come around to understand why the complexity is needed. Even still it&#8217;s
    almost become a cliche to remark on how hard this project is.</p>

    <p>Second, the goal of the project is aimed squarely at interoperability. It hopes
    to chart a course through very difficult waters to unite many of the big players
    in the land of &#8220;big E&#8221;. Instead of staking out its turf and fighting
    to the bitter end, the project is trying to help companies get their heterogeneous
    environments to work together. From my early days working with (and on) Linux
    to focusing on open web standards, this is a goal I can easily get behind.</p>

    <p>In the Ruby (and also Agile) world we often talk about working in the Enterprise.
    <a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/blog">Glenn Vanderburg</a> has said, &#8220;The
    Enterprise isn&#8217;t ready for Ruby, it&#8217;s desperate for it.&#8221; After
    escaping the Enterprise, I&#8217;ve been very suspicious of working with it again.
    Frankly, I&#8217;ve passed on a couple projects that flew too close to the sun.
    This is a project though that allows me to push my ideals into the Enterprise. </p>'

  Title: Configuring Ubuntu 10.04 for Rails Development
  Body: ! '<p>While mentoring local high school students we needed to configure a
    number of systems for <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> development.
    <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> seemed to be the most reasonable choice
    of OS. Below are the configuration steps we used broken into one-time setup, repeatable
    demo app creation, and next steps.</p>

  Title: Web apps are dead, long live web apps
  Body: ! '<p>I was at rubyconf today talking to a guy who hates building web apps.
     I think a lot of developers feel this way, even a lot of web developers.  I know
    I did, to some degree, even though I would tell you (and believe that) deploying
    software as a web application is the best way to go for most cases.  What was
    interesting to me in talking to the guy were some of the reasons he gave:</p>

    <ul class="ul1"><li>Web apps are just way too chatty.  Every time I want to do
    anything it&#8217;s a round trip to the server to figure out what to do next</li>

    <li class="li1">Javascript is just such a horrible language.  It was some guys
    experiment that got shoved into the browser and now I have to use it.  I don&#8217;t
    have any choice in what language to use</li>

    </ul><p class="p1">These are rough paraphrases; hopefully the speaker, should
    he read this post, will forgive me.  But I think these are common reactions.  And
    if you read no further in this post, here&#8217;s the TL;DR: they <strong>no longer
    apply</strong>.  These reactions are based on the way we&#8217;ve built web apps
    for the past 10 years or so.  But now it is time to stop.  </p>

    <p class="p1">The chatty question first: the problem he alludes is one of the
    most limiting features about the way web apps used to be built.  Because the first
    version of the web is built around each user action resulting in an http request/response
    cycle, server frameworks were architected around this idea.  The server framework
    would handle each user action and send back a wad of html and javascript that
    would (hopefully) tell the browser what to do next.  Building interesting, usable
    applications this way is frustrating, to put it mildly.</p>

    <p class="p1">But of course AJAX came along to rescue us from all this.  So what,
    right?  AJAX is not new, it&#8217;s been mainstream for 5 years, at least.  But
    believe it not, it&#8217;s full potential is really just now starting to be realized.
     The full potential is that it frees us from tying user actions to a request/response
    cycle.  But to realize this potential, we need to completely change the way we
    build web applications.  As in, throw away almost everything you knew, including
    (most of) your server side framework.  As in, if you&#8217;re building a web application
    with the existing &#8220;state of the art&#8221; approach, you are a writing instant
    legacy code.</p>

    <p class="p1">So what do we do?  It&#8217;s time to re-tool: that server side
    framework is on the wrong tier.  We need to move it to the client.  Backbone.js
    is the best client side MVC framework I&#8217;ve used, but there are certainly
    others.</p>

    <p class="p1">The next question: javascript.  While I disagree with this guy&#8217;s
    vehement hate, I can certainly understand the frustration.  Javascript has some
    excellent features, but it&#8217;s not my favorite language.  And the fact that
    I&#8217;m forced to use it makes me want to demand: FREEDOM! in a Mel Gibson painted
    half-blue and being sliced open kind of way.  I want to choose what language to
    use, and I want it to let me write expressive, beautiful code.</p>

    <p class="p1">And now I can, with coffeescript.  I really can&#8217;t overstate
    the effect this has had on my approach to web app development.  If I look back
    honestly, I&#8217;ve known for maybe years that I&#8217;m doing it wrong.  Even
    though I love my chosen server side language, Ruby, so very much, I could tell
    that trying to build the UI for my web apps in it just wasn&#8217;t working out.
     I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to totally embrace the javascript, though
    I tried (maybe a bit half-assedly).  But this changed completely with coffeescript.
     I love the code I write in this language, and I can get behind it in a non-half-assed
    way.</p>

    <p class="p1">As you&#8217;ve probably picked up, I&#8217;m pretty passionate
    about this stuff.  Part of it is that I&#8217;m so pumped that I finally have
    good solutions to problems that have been vexing me for years.  But I also want
    to help others get on board.  A lot of folks already are, but if you&#8217;re
    not, or just want help getting there we got your back.  Gaslight Software is offering
    our training class, <a href="http://training.gaslightsoftware.com">Beautiful Front
    End Code with Backbone and Coffeescript</a> in San Francisco on November 7th and
    8th.</p>'
